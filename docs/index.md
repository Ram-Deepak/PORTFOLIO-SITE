## Software Engineer

Hi! I am a developer, passionate about technology and statistics. I am interested in web development and data science.

I am a dual degree student pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (pre-final year) from Sri Eshwar College of Engineering and an online degree in Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Applications (Diploma level student) from Indian Institute of Technology Madras.

I love developing applications using flask and sqlalchemy. Have good knowledge of RESTful API. Good at Data Structures and Algorithms. Solved more than 1800+ problems across platforms like Leetcode, Codechef and Skillrack.

I am fascinated by the realm of tech and wanted to make an impact on the lives of millions of people by finding out accurate solutions that would solve many problems.

Looking for an entry-level position as a Software Engineer in a dynamic firm that provides scope for updating my knowledge. I seek a company that will help me contribute to its development while concurrently aiding my personal growth.
